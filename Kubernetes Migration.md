# Migration and Deployment Strategies in Kubernetes

When migrating services or launching new ones in Kubernetes, especially during server downtime or upgrades, it's crucial to choose the right deployment strategy. Below are four common strategies, each with its own process and use case.

## 1️⃣ Recreate Deployment
### Process
- Terminates all old pods before creating new ones.
- This means there will be a period of downtime where no instances of the application are running.

### Use Case
- Suitable for stateful applications where downtime is acceptable.
- **Example:** A database migration where you need to ensure data consistency and can afford a brief downtime.

## 2️⃣ Rolling Update
### Process
- Gradually replaces old pods with new ones.
- Kubernetes will slowly terminate old pods and bring up new ones, ensuring that the application remains available throughout the process.

### Use Case
- Ideal for stateless applications to ensure zero downtime during updates.
- **Example:** A web server where you want to ensure continuous availability while updating to a new version.

## 3️⃣ Blue-Green Deployment
### Process
- Runs two identical environments (blue and green) and switches traffic from blue to green.
- The blue environment runs the current version, while the green environment runs the new version. Once the green environment is tested and ready, traffic is switched from blue to green.

### Use Case
- Ensures quick rollback if issues are detected, perfect for critical applications.
- **Example:** A financial application where you need to ensure that the new version is stable before fully switching over.

## 4️⃣ Canary Deployment
### Process
- Releases new versions to a small subset of users before full rollout.
- This allows you to test the new version in a production environment with minimal risk.

### Use Case
- Mitigates risk by testing updates on a limited scale.
- **Example:** A social media platform where you want to test a new feature with a small group of users before rolling it out to everyone.

## Summary Table
| Strategy         | Process                                          | Use Case |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Recreate        | Terminates all old pods before creating new ones | Stateful applications where downtime is acceptable |
| Rolling Update  | Gradually replaces old pods with new ones        | Stateless applications to ensure zero downtime during updates |
| Blue-Green      | Runs two identical environments and switches traffic from blue to green | Critical applications requiring quick rollback if issues are detected |
| Canary          | Releases new versions to a small subset of users before full rollout | Mitigates risk by testing updates on a limited scale |

## Choosing the Right Strategy
- **Recreate Deployment:** Use when you can afford downtime and need to ensure data consistency.
- **Rolling Update:** Use for stateless applications where continuous availability is crucial.
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Use for critical applications where you need a quick rollback option.
- **Canary Deployment:** Use when you want to test new features or updates with minimal risk.

By understanding these strategies, you can make informed decisions on how to migrate services and launch new ones in Kubernetes, ensuring minimal downtime and risk.
